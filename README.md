Overview

This project involved the development of a Power BI dashboard to provide Atliq Technologies with actionable insights into employee presence data. The dashboard enables HR managers to understand employee working preferences, attendance patterns, and sick leave trends, facilitating informed decision-making to enhance employee engagement, optimize resource allocation, and promote health and safety initiatives.

Data Set Description

The dataset utilized in this project consists of employee presence data for three months, encompassing employee IDs, dates, and attendance key codes. The attendance key codes indicate whether an employee was present, absent, working from home, or on sick leave.

Project Scope

The project encompassed the following objectives:

Data Acquisition and Transformation:
a. Collect employee presence data from three separate Excel spreadsheets, each representing a month's worth of data.
b. Consolidate the data into a single, unified dataset using Power Query's data merging and transformation capabilities.

Data Analysis and Visualization:
a. Perform data analysis using DAX measures to calculate key metrics such as working preference percentages, attendance rates, sick leave reasons, and seasonal patterns.
b. Create interactive and informative visualizations using Power BI's charting and table functionalities.

Dashboard Development:
a. Design and develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that effectively communicates the insights derived from data analysis.
b. Implement interactive filters and drill-down capabilities to enable users to explore the data at various levels of granularity.

Power Query Data Transformation

The project utilized three separate Excel files, each containing one month of employee presence data. To consolidate and analyze the data effectively, Power Query was employed to create a template table with consistent column headers and merge the three Excel files into this unified structure. This process ensured data integrity and streamlined subsequent data transformation and analysis.

DAX measures were employed to calculate key metrics such as:

Working Preference Percentage: A measure to determine the percentage of employees working from home or in the office.
Attendance Percentage: A measure to calculate the percentage of employees present on a given day, week, or month.
Sick Leave Reasons: A measure to identify the number of employees taking sick leave for each reason.
Sick Leave Patterns: A measure to detect patterns in sick leave, such as seasonal fluctuations or spikes around specific dates.

Project: Atliq HR Analytics - Presence Insights

Overview

This project involved the development of a Power BI dashboard to provide Atliq Technologies with actionable insights into employee presence data. The dashboard enables HR managers to understand employee working preferences, attendance patterns, and sick leave trends, facilitating informed decision-making to enhance employee engagement, optimize resource allocation, and promote health and safety initiatives.

Data Preparation

The project utilized three separate Excel files, each containing one month of employee presence data. To consolidate and analyze the data effectively, Power Query was employed to create a template table with consistent column headers and merge the three Excel files into this unified structure. This process ensured data integrity and streamlined subsequent data transformation and analysis.

Data Transformation and DAX Calculations

Data transformation involved cleaning and preparing the consolidated dataset for meaningful analysis. This included removing duplicate rows, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency. DAX measures were then created to extract key insights from the data. These measures included:

Working Preferences: Calculated the percentage of employees who work from home (WFH) or in the office, providing insights into employee preferences and potential space utilization optimization opportunities.

Attendance Percentage: Determined the percentage of employees present on a given day, week, or month, enabling HR managers to monitor attendance trends and identify potential issues.

Sick Leave Reasons: Analyzed the reasons for sick leave, providing valuable information for understanding employee health and wellbeing.

Sick Leave Patterns: Identified patterns in sick leave data, such as seasonal fluctuations or spikes around holidays, helping HR anticipate potential health-related issues.

Data Visualization

To effectively communicate the extracted insights, a variety of charts and tables were created. Charts, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, provided visual representations of the key metrics, making it easy to grasp trends and patterns. Tables, on the other hand, offered detailed information, such as employee attendance by date and sick leave reasons by employee.

Impact

The Power BI dashboard has empowered Atliq Technologies to make data-driven decisions regarding employee engagement, resource allocation, and health and safety initiatives. The dashboard's ability to provide actionable insights into employee presence data has enabled the company to:

Understand employee working preferences and optimize office space utilization.

Identify attendance trends and address potential attendance issues promptly.

Gain insights into employee health and wellbeing, allowing for targeted interventions.

Anticipate potential health-related issues based on sick leave patterns.

Overall, the project successfully transformed employee presence data into actionable insights, enhancing Atliq Technologies' ability to manage its workforce effectively and promote a healthy and productive work environment.
